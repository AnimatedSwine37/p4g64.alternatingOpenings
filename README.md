# p4g64.alternatingOpenings
A mod for Persona 4 Golden Steam that makes the opening alternate between Shadow World and Pursuing My True Self if you let it play multiple times by waiting on the main menu.

## Extra Options
In the mod's configuration you can also either force Pursuing My True Self to be played first or randomise which plays first.

## Compatibility
Note that if you have the [P4 Opening Movie mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/50955) enabled as well as this, the first opening played will always be Pursuing My True Self, regardless of load order or this mod's configuration. This was done intentionally for people who already had that mod installed and enabled.
